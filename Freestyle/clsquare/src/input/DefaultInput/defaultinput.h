/** Default implementation for an input module with range- and file-based modes.
  * Supports several basic input modes, which are toggled by the parameter
  * \b input_mode.
  * \li \e from_file: assumes that the file given by \b input_file contains a
  *     list of initial states, with entries being separated by spaces.
  *     States from this file will be used in serial order by default, or
  *     in random order if \b order_of_presentation has been set to \e random.
  * \li \e random: randomly chooses initial states from the CLS::Util::SetDef range
  *     specified by \b xinit. Dimensions left blank in xinit will be filled
  *     with NaN. The input range can be increased over time through
  *     the parameters \b growth_freq and \b growth_step, the latter of which
  *     is also a CLS::Util::SetDef, specifying the step size in either direction. The
  *     maximum range can be specified by \b growth_limit.
  * \li \e none: simply returns a list of NaN.
  *
  * If the parameter \b protfile has been defined, the input states that
  * were chosen each episode are logged in the file it refers to.
  *
  * The input module also provides a mechanism for generating reference
  * inputs for plants that require such. Unlike initial states, reference
  * inputs may change throughout the episode. The frequency at which they
  * are chosen is determined by the parameter \b ref_inp_change_freq (at the
  * default of -1, inputs are only changed at the beginning of each episode),
  * and the number of changes can be limited by \b ref_inp_change_num. If
  * \b ref_inp_integrating is set to \e true, new values are added to the
  * old ones rather than replacing them.
  *
  * The method of generating the reference input is determined on a per-
  * dimension basis by the parameter \b ref_inp_modes, which is expected
  * to be a list of the same length as the plant's reference input
  * dimension.
  * \li 0: Uses a one-dimensional linear interpolation function of type
  *     InterpolLinFun1D. For each dimension \e i, a parameter
  *     \b ref_inp_fun_i must define the name of a file where the
  *     function is described.
  * \li 1: Randomly draws values from a CLS::Util::SetDef range, which is defined
  *     for each dimension \e i by \b ref_inp_range_i.
  * \li 2: Uses a parameterized standard input function.
  *     For each dimension \e, expects a parametrization \b
  *     ref_inp_stdfun_params_i, which contains a list \f$p\f$ of
  *     length 5. Each reference input is then computed through the
  *     formula \f$r_1 sin ( \frac{ 2\pi ( c\Delta_t + r_3 ) }
  *     { r_0 } ) + r_2\f$ until the time \f$c\Delta_t \geq r_4\f$
  *     has elapsed, and 0 afterwards. If \f$r_4\f$ is negative,
  *     no timeout is used.
  * \li 3: Calculates the reference input through the same function
  *     as mode 2, but accepts multiple parametrizations for each
  *     dimensions. Parameters are defined as \b
  *     ref_inp_stdfun_params_i_h, with \e h being a continuous
  *     index starting at 0. The module cycles through these
  *     parameter sets, switching to then next one at the beginning
  *     of each episode.
  * \li 4: Gets values from a GUI interface via TCP/IP, such as the
  *     GraphicalUserInterface tool bundled with CLSquare. For each
  *     dimension \e i, a parameter \b ref_gui_i must define a
  *     valid request string of the form "SLIDER <label> <min> <max>
  *     <default> <steps>".
