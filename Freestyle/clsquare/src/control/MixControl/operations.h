/** MixControl operation to choose an action based on the current state.
  * Basic parameters are the same as for every MixControlOperation.
  * The parameter \b controller_0 describes the index of the default controller, \b controller_1 is the one chosen
  * under certain conditions. The secondary controller will be activated as soon as the state is within any of the
  * StateDef sets described by the config parameters \b activate_x, where \e x is a continuous index starting at zero.
  * The controller supports hysteresis; once the secondary action has been activated, it will be used until any
  * condition described by the parameters \b release_x is met. If no release condition is specified, the default
  * action will be resumed as soon as the activation criteria are not met anymore. If activation and release areas
  * overlap, the default action is preferred.
