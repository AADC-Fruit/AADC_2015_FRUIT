/**
  * Implements a number of simple controllers, all of which will attempt to generate the state vector specified
  * by the paramete \b targets, or the null vector by default, by generating adjustments based on the current state
  * on a per-state-dimension basis.
  *
  * The most important setting is the parameter \b mode, which toggles the type of controller used.
  * \li \e BangBang: gives +1 if the state is lower than the target, -1 if higher, or 0 if exactly there
  * \li \e Proportional: simple proportional control; takes an additional parameter \b scaling that the state will
  *     be divided by to yield the action (default: 1); \b scaling should be a list of the same length as the action
  *     dimension, but will be padded with the first entry if shorter
  *     \note This is \e not a classical P-controller, and does not generate a signal relative to an error, but to
  *           the state; to emulate a P-controller, just use a negative scaling.
  * \li \e ThreePoint: like BangBang, but with a histeresis margin around the goal in which the action 0 is chosen,
  *     defined by the parameter \b margin (default: 0.5); the list of values will be padded in the same manner as
  *     \b scaling above
  * \li \e FivePoint: like ThreePoint, but with two different zones in which different actions are chosen; is within
  *     the area defined by \b inner, it will be 0, if outside \b inner but within \b outer, then 0.5, and 1 if
  *     outside \b outer; the lists of values will be padded in the same manner as \b scaling above
  * \li \e Static: always returns the same action, defined by \b value; the lists of values will be padded in the
  *     same manner as \b scaling above
  *
  * All controllers generate an action in \f$[-1:1]\f$ by default, unless modified through additional parameters.
  * \li \b negative <bool>: if set to false, output actions will be scaled between 0 and 1
  *     (default: \e false)
  * \li \b multi <\f$a\times\f$ bool>: multiplier that will be applied to the controller-generated 
  *     action (default: \f$[a\times 1]\f$)
  * \li \b limit <bool>: if set to false, actions will no longer be limited to the range \f$[-1:1]\f$, but use
  *     the absolute output of the module; (default: \e true for MixControlStatic, \e false for all other types)
  *
  * If the action is of a lower dimensionality than the state, state dimensions must be assigned to action
  * dimensions through the parameter \b assignment <\f$a\times\f$ double> (default: [0 1 2...]).
