/** @defgroup PLANT Plant Modules
  * The plant module implements the behaviour of the system under investigation, how it behaves over time and the influence of actions applied to it.
  * Its main functionality is to compute time discrete dynamic: \f$\plantstate_{t+1} = f(\plantstate_{t},\action_{t})\f$ (potentially dependent on t and subject to noise).
  * Examples:
  * \li simple rule based system behaviour (e.g. CatAndMouse grid example)
  * \li numerical simulations of dynamic systems (e.g. Acrobot example)
  * \li external applications by means of communication (e.g. TCP communication to a Matlab simulation)
  * \li real systems by communication with hardware
  *
  * Main functionality is the function
  * virtual bool Plant::get_next_plant_state(const double *current_plant_state, const double *current_action, double *next_plant_state);
  * that defines the dynamic of the plant.

/** @defgroup HARDWARE Hardware Plants
  * These Plant modules require robots or other hardware systems.
  * Some may include a simulation and can be used without the hardware,
  * in which case they should be listed in the Simulated Plant group.
  * \warning When designing a hardware plant, please ensure that the
  * function notify_command_string() covers the argument
  * "plant_cmd pause" and stops the physical system. Failure to do so
  * may result in damage as the control loop stops but the hardware
  * continues moving.
